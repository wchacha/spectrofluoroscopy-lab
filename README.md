# Spectrofluorometry Lab Report

This lab focused on analyzing how different dyes behave under fluorescence when excited by specific wavelengths. We used a Jasco FP-8550 spectrofluorometer to measure excitation and emission spectra for four dye samples: Coumarin 440, Coumarin 460, DCM, and Fluorescein.

### Summary

- Measured emission and excitation spectra for each dye sample  
- Used fixed absorbance values from literature due to limitations with the absorbance function on the spectrofluorometer  
- Created 3D emission vs. excitation plots to visually compare how each dye responded  
- Observed Stokes shifts between excitation and emission spectra  
- Fluorescein showed the broadest emission and some irregularities compared to others

### Equipment & Materials

- Jasco FP-8550 Spectrofluorometer  
- Samples: Coumarin 440 (Methanol), Coumarin 460 (Methanol), DCM (DMSO), Fluorescein (Methanol)

### Key Takeaways

- Learned how to set up and operate a spectrofluorometer  
- Gained experience collecting and interpreting spectral data  
- Understood how solvent and dye properties affect fluorescence response  
- Cross-checked our results with published data to validate what we observed
